# Vuetify Docs POC
>
> 💡 A draft for alternative vuetify docs with a completely restructured and redesigned layout & navigation.
> This is neither fully designed, nor responsive as it's just a poc.
>

This project contains a re-work of the vuetifyjs docs showing structural reworks. With the re-structured navigation things will be easier to find and the menu + toolbar end up less cluttered.
